      <p>🎤 "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the world-famous Louvre Museum! Follow me closely, because we’re approaching one of the most iconic masterpieces in all of art history — the Mona Lisa!"</p>
      <p>🎨 "Now, take a look just ahead — yes, that small painting behind the glass, always surrounded by a crowd. That’s her. The Mona Lisa. Painted by none other than Leonardo da Vinci, around the year 1503 to 1506 — although da Vinci, being the perfectionist he was, likely kept adding touches until about 1517."</p>
      <p>🖼️ "What makes her so famous, you ask? Well, it’s not just her smile — though that mysterious, almost secretive grin is legendary. It’s the way her eyes seem to follow you, her lifelike presence, and the innovative painting techniques da Vinci used. This work is a stunning example of sfumato — that soft blending of colors that gives her skin its silky texture."</p>
      <p>📏 "And yes, folks — she’s smaller than most expect! The painting is just 77 by 53 centimeters — about 30 by 21 inches. But don’t let the size fool you. She packs centuries of fascination into that frame."</p>
      <p>🔍 "Art historians believe the model was Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a wealthy Florentine merchant — hence the name ‘Mona Lisa,’ which is short for ‘Madonna Lisa.’ But da Vinci never gave it to her family — he kept it with him until he died in France."</p>
      <p>🖼️ "Today, she sits in this climate-controlled, bulletproof glass case, drawing more than 10 million visitors a year. And yes — she’s smiling at you too."</p>
      <p>📸 "Feel free to take your photos, but remember: no flash! And when you're done, follow me — we've got thousands more treasures to discover!"</p>
